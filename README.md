•	 What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In the projects for CS 300, our main objective was to develop a program that would generate a sample schedule and course information

•	How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Understanding data structures played a vital role in approaching this problem. Rather than redundantly coding for each course entry, we leveraged appropriate data structures to efficiently store and retrieve course information. This not only reduced code complexity but also improved runtime efficiency. Data structures helped us manage the schedule and course data more effectively, enabling faster access and manipulation.

•	How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

During the project, I encountered some challenges. In these instances, I used all my available resources and found solutions to the problems.

•	How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Working on this project prompted me to rethink my approach to software design. The algorithms we learned became valuable tools in developing a program that could efficiently handle and present data. The project challenged me to think critically about how I interpret problems and develop solutions.

•	How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project taught me the importance of creating adaptable, maintainable, and readable programs. The need to produce a functional program while maintaining code quality pushed me to structure my code more thoughtfully. Writing clear comments, breaking down code into modular components, and adhering to best practices became essential to ensure that my work was maintainable and easily comprehensible.
